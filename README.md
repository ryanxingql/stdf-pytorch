# *Spatio-Temporal Deformable Convolution for Compressed Video Quality Enhancement* (AAAI 2020)

:rocket: **Note**: We implement STDF based on MMEditing at [PowerQE](https://github.com/ryanxingql/powerqe).

## 0. Background

PyTorch implementation of [*Spatio-Temporal Deformable Convolution for Compressed Video Quality Enhancement*](https://www.aiide.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6697) (AAAI 2020).

- A **simple** and **effective** video quality enhancement network.
- Adopt **feature alignment** by multi-frame **deformable convolutions**, instead of motion estimation and motion compensation.

**Notice**: The dataset and training method are different from those in the original paper.

## 1. Pre-request

### 1.1. Environment

```bash
conda create -n stdf python=3.7 -y && conda activate stdf

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ryanxingql/stdf-pytorch && cd stdf-pytorch/

# given CUDA 10.1
python -m pip install torch==1.6.0+cu101 torchvision==0.7.0+cu101 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

python -m pip install tqdm lmdb pyyaml opencv-python scikit-image
```

### 1.2. DCNv2

#### Build DCNv2

```bash
cd ops/dcn/
bash build.sh
```

#### Check if DCNv2 works (optional)

```bash
python simple_check.py
```

> The DCNv2 source files here is different from the [open-sourced version](https://github.com/chengdazhi/Deformable-Convolution-V2-PyTorch) due to incompatibility. [[issue]](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting/issues/84#issuecomment-644974315)

### 1.3. MFQEv2 dataset

#### Download and compress videos

Please check [here](https://github.com/ryanxingql/mfqev2.0/wiki/MFQEv2-Dataset).

#### Edit YML

We now edit `option_R3_mfqev2_4G.yml`.

Suppose the folder `MFQEv2_dataset/` is placed at `/raid/xql/datasets/MFQEv2_dataset/`, then you should assign `/raid/xql/datasets/MFQEv2_dataset/` to `dataset -> train -> root` in YAML.

> `R3`: one of the network structures provided in the paper; `mfqev2`: MFQEv2 dataset will be adopted; `4G`: 4 GPUs will be used for the below training. Similarly, you can also edit `option_R3_mfqev2_1G.yml` and `option_R3_mfqev2_2G.yml` if needed.

#### Generate LMDB

We now generate LMDB to speed up IO during training.

```bash
python create_lmdb_mfqev2.py --opt_path option_R3_mfqev2_4G.yml
```

Now you will get all needed data:

```txt
MFQEv2_dataset/
├── train_108/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── HM16.5_LDP/
│       └── QP37/
├── test_18/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── HM16.5_LDP/
│       └── QP37/
├── mfqev2_train_gt.lmdb/
└── mfqev2_train_lq.lmdb/
```

Finally, the MFQEv2 dataset root will be sym-linked to the folder `./data/` automatically.

> So that we and programmes can access MFQEv2 dataset at `./data/` directly.

## 2. Train

See `script.sh`.

## 3. Test

Pretrained models can be found here: [[Releases]](https://github.com/ryanxingql/stdf-pytorch/releases) and [[百度网盘 (stdf)]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1I-c95lJYLNmIQALzqelWYA)

### 3.1. Test MFQEv2 dataset after training

See `script.sh`.

### 3.2. Test MFQEv2 dataset without training

If you did not run `create_lmdb` for training, you should first sym-link MFQEv2 dataset to `./data/`.

```bash
mkdir data/
ln -s /your/path/to/MFQEv2_dataset/ data/MFQEv2
```

Download the pre-trained model, and see `script.sh`.

### 3.3. Test your own video

First download the pre-trained model, and then run:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test_one_video.py
```

See `test_one_video.py` for more details.

## 4. Result

## 5. Q&A

### 5.1. Vimeo-90K dataset

You should download the Vimeo-90K dataset, convert these PNG sequences into 7-frame YCbCr YUV444P videos, then compress these videos under QP37, All Intra, HM16.5.

We also provide one-click programme at [[Releases]](https://github.com/ryanxingql/stdf-pytorch/releases) and [[百度网盘 (stdf)]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1I-c95lJYLNmIQALzqelWYA).

```tex
Vimeo-90K/
├── vimeo_septuplet/
│   └── ...
├── vimeo_septuplet_ycbcr/
│   └── ...
└── vimeo_septuplet_ycbcr_intra/
    └── ...
```

The LMDB preparation, option YAML, training and test codes have been already provided in this repository.

### 5.2. Why the epoch index starts from 0, while the iter index (also model index) starts from 1

Small bug. I may fix it some time.

### 5.3. How do we enlarge the dataset

Following BasicSR, we set `sampling index = target index % dataset len`.

For example, if we have a dataset which volume is 4 and enlargement ratio is 2, then we will sample images at indexes equal 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3. Note that at each sampling, we will randomly crop the image. Therefore, the patches cropped at the same image but different times can be different.

Besides, the data loader will be shuffled at the start of each epoch. Enlarging epoch can help reduce the total starting times.

### 5.4. Why do we set the number of iteration, not epoch

Considering that we can enlarge the dataset with various ratio, the number of epoch is meaningless. In the meanwhile, the number of iteration indicates the number of sampling batches, which is more meaningful to us.
